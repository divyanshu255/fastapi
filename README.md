# Secure File Sharing System (FastAPI + MongoDB)

## ðŸš€ Deployment Plan for Production Environment

To deploy this application securely and scalably to production, we follow industry-standard best practices. Here's a step-by-step deployment strategy:

---

### âœ… 1. Containerization with Docker

We will containerize the application using **Docker** to ensure portability and consistency across environments.

- Create a `Dockerfile` to build the FastAPI app.
- Use **Uvicorn with Gunicorn** for async performance and robustness.
- Use a `.env` file or secrets manager for sensitive credentials.

### âœ… 2. MongoDB Hosting

We will use **MongoDB Atlas** for a managed cloud database, which provides:

- SSL encryption
- Auto backups
- Role-based access control
- Scalability

### âœ… 3. Environment Variables

Store sensitive data securely using:

- `.env` file in dev
- **GitHub Actions Secrets**, **Docker Secrets**, or **AWS Parameter Store** in prod

### âœ… 4. Reverse Proxy with Nginx

Set up **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to:

- Handle HTTPS via **Let's Encrypt** or SSL certs
- Route traffic to the Uvicorn/Gunicorn server
- Serve static files if needed

### âœ… 5. Deployment Options

You can deploy using any of the following:

- **Render**, **Railway**, or **Fly.io** for zero-config cloud deployment
- **AWS EC2** or **Lightsail** for full control
- **Docker Compose** on a VPS
- **Kubernetes** for large-scale environments

### âœ… 6. Security Practices

- Enforce **HTTPS**
- Use **JWT tokens** for authenticated access
- Encrypt download links using **Fernet**
- Restrict file access by user roles
- Sanitize and validate all inputs

### âœ… 7. CI/CD Automation (Optional)

Use **GitHub Actions** to:

- Run tests
- Build Docker image
- Push to Docker Hub or AWS ECR
- Deploy to your server with zero downtime
